# Wall Maker v1.0.4 Release Notes

## Overview
Wall Maker v1.0.4 brings significant performance improvements and enhanced functionality to automatic wall generation in Foundry VTT. This release focuses on optimizing the edge detection process, improving memory management, and enhancing the overall stability of wall generation, particularly in challenging lighting conditions.

## New Features

### Enhanced Edge Detection
- **WebGL Acceleration**: Implemented WebGL-based processing for significantly faster edge detection
- **Configurable Processing Pipeline**: New options for fine-tuning the image processing workflow
- **Chunk-based Processing**: Better handling of large scenes through optimized chunk-based image analysis
- **Early Exit Conditions**: Improved performance through smart processing termination

### Image Enhancement Improvements
- **Adaptive Histogram Equalization**: Better handling of dark and low-contrast scenes
- **Exposure Compensation**: Improved detection in varying lighting conditions
- **Pattern Recognition**: Enhanced detection of decorative elements and complex textures

### Performance Optimizations
- **Memory Usage**: Significantly reduced memory footprint during processing
- **Processing Speed**: Faster wall generation through optimized algorithms
- **Resource Management**: Better handling of system resources during large scene processing

## Bug Fixes
- Resolved memory leaks in image processing pipeline
- Fixed stability issues when processing large scene images
- Improved error handling in edge detection process
- Better handling of wall detection in dark scenes
- Enhanced noise reduction in edge detection

## Installation
1. Download the module from the release page
2. Extract the zip file to your Foundry VTT modules directory
3. Enable the module in your world's module settings

## Compatibility
- Foundry VTT: v11.x and v12.7
- Requires no additional modules
- Compatible with all standard map types and scene configurations

## Known Issues
- Processing very large scenes (>8000x8000 pixels) may require additional memory
- Some highly detailed textures may require manual sensitivity adjustment

## Configuration Tips
- For optimal performance in dark scenes, enable the adaptive histogram equalization option
- Adjust sensitivity settings based on your map's contrast levels
- Use the chunk size setting to balance between processing speed and memory usage
